  Flattens given sequence of sequences to a sequence with items of

  are ordered by the time rather then index, in other words if
  item from the second sub-sequence is deliver earlier then the item
  from first sub-sequence it will in appear earlier in the resulting
  sequence too. If you need to keep order by index you should enforce
  sequential ordering by wrapping `source` into `sequential` before
  passing it to flatten.
