  /**
  Function takes `source` sequence and an `f` function, which is used to
  intercept each non-boxed item of the sequence. It is invoked with `next`
  continuation function, sequence `value` being yielded and accumulated
  `result`. `f` is supposed to call `next` with a intercepted `value` and
  `result`.

  This enables writing transformation functions that don't deal with
  back-channel in form of boxed values. In other words transformation
  functions like `filter` and `map` just intercept values but they don't
  change size of sequence or handle errors there for they want to bypass
  back-channel by using transform`.

  For examples of use see `map`, `filter` etc... Some functions that want
  to change size of sequence should use `transformer` instead, for examples
  of those see `take`, `takeWhile`.
